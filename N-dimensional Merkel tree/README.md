# N-dimensional Merkel Tree
 # Overview
This repository contains all the documents associated with the N-dimensional Merkel tree and Proof-of-Quantum-Verification protocol. 

# File Descriptions

- **N-dimensional Merkel Tree.pdf**: The proposed protocol is explained in complete detail in this document.

- **Unpublished-Research-Paper**: A research paper that highlights this protocol and the results of the simulations carried out is put up for reference. We are actively looking at conferences and journals to publish this.  Model1.nlogo and Model2.nlogo have been tweaked slightly for the desired simulations in this paper. 

-**Model1.nlogo**: This contains the NetLogo simulation code for the conventional Proof-of-Work protocol.

-**Model2.nlogo**: This contains the NetLogo simulation code for the proposed Proof-of-Quantum Verification protocol.

-**SimulationResults.pdf**: Summarizes the results obtained on running all the simulations. 



 # How to Use Model1.nlogo  and Model2.nlogo

1.	Open the Command Console of the NetLogo Simulator after uploading the nlogo file to the NetLogo Editor.
2.	Select the view (Observer) and enter **setup**  to setup the simulation environment.
3.	Enter the following commands after setup

>**repeat  n [ go ]**  where n is the number of times you wish to run the simulation for

4.	Enter the following function name:

>**calculate-gini**
This will generate the Gini index and total wealth for that simulation.

5.	Repeat steps 2 to 5 for different n-values
