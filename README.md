# Lattice-Cryptography

# Overview
This directory contains protocols developed during the research internship (S.R.F.P) in 2023, aiming to explore quantum-resistant algorithms for the Blockchain environment. The research focuses on replacing conventional cryptographic algorithms that are vulnerable and in use today.

**Project Introduction Document:**
The Project Introduction document lays the foundation for the necessity of developing new quantum-resistant protocols. It was submitted as the four-week report to the Indian Academy of Sciences (IAS).

**Protocols**
1. **Learning with Errors (LWE) Digital Signature Scheme**:
 - This protocol explores the integration of the LWE problem, a quantum-resistant algorithm, into the digital signature scheme used in Blockchain environments. A detailed report highlighting the various entities involved in this protocol is provided inside the LWE DS Scheme folder.

2. **N-dimensionalizing the Merkle Tree (Proof of Quantum Verification)**:
 - This protocol demonstrates leveraging the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), another quantum resistant algorithm, to create a new consensus algorithm named Proof-of0Quantum-Verification(PoQuVe) for validating mined blocks.
   
 - A detailed report highlighting the protocol’s proposed approach is provided inside the Ndimensionalising the Merkel Tree folder. Agent-based simulation models written in NetLogo, to simulate the wealth disparity trends in the conventional and proposed protocol is also provided in this directory.
